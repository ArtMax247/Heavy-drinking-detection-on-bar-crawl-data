Excessive alcohol consumption leads to 5.3% of all deaths worldwide [WHO 2018] and yet is preventable. Promising strides have been made towards creating Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered through mobile applications just before the beginning of a heavy drinking episodes. Research suggests timely notification reduces this risky behaviour and frequent notifications reduces intervention effectiveness, emphasising the timeliness and accuracy of these notifications. However, identifing heavy drinking episodes is challenging because of the unpredictablity of such episodes and the unavailability of blood alcohol content (BAC) data without selection bias. Hence, creating a classifier which accurately predicts heavy drinking episodes apart from the sober period is crucial. This paper [Learning to detect heavy drinking episodes using smartphone accelerometer data](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2429/paper6.pdf) proposes an alternative approach, where accelerometer data is used to predict heavy drinking episides and deliver JITAIs accurately. This project makes use of the data collected from this research to employ permutation entropy (PE) and permutation complexity (PC) methods to differentiate the heavy drinking episodes from the sober period.
